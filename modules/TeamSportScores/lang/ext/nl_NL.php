$lang['help'] = '<h3>What Does This Do?</h3>
<p>In short: it allows you to enter matches and later on the scores. The matches can be shown the front end part.<br>
Team Sport Scores allows you to prepare teams within a club. Each team consists therefore of members that are able to play a sport. 
	The sport played is equal for each team within a club.<br>
However there might be also, something we called, an association that groups clubs into one name.<br>
Each team plays the sport during a season. Since per sport there might be different seasons
(ie the baseball competion is played in one calendar year, where as field hockey is played from the autumn of one year up until
summer of next year), you may use a specific season code per team.<br>
</p>
<h3>How Do I Use It</h3>
<p>After installation, enter one or more matches. Then place a smarty tag in a page or template using &#123;cms_module module=\'TeamSportScores\'}.<br> 
An example is: {cms_module module=\'TeamSportScores\' team=\'3\'}<br>
This will show all the matches that are linked to team 3 (both played as matches to be played).</p> 
There are a number of parameters that can be used. See below and the manual for examples. Manuals can be found on the 
	<a href="http://dev.cmsmadesimple.org/docman/?group_id=430">projects documentation page</a>.
